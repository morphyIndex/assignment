    <h1><center>Basic HTML Display Features</center></h1>
    <font face="Courier New">A basic page needs only a bare minium of porgramming. Graphics are an important part of Web pages but so too are words.I look upon the Web as a medium for ideas and the use of new techologies, but not the other way around. A web page tells a great story with graet graphical and analytical presentation.</font>
    <p>Using the "View" option look at the source code for this document. The background color and the text declared in the body refer to a coding system that combines a system of numbers and letters to create a thousand of possible color choices. The body color indicates while and the text as being black. I could have just written in "white" and "black" instead of these colors.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of a horizontal rule:</p>
    <p>To begin, we can change the</p>
    <br>
    <h3>header size</h3>
    <br>
    <p>and <font color = "blue">color</font> <font color = "red">of</font> <font color = "green">letters</font> seen on the screen. The <font size = "7">Font Size</font> can be changed as well, and actually gives more choices.</p>
    <p>We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some differing word types in a blocked quote. Now is the time for all good <b>people</b> to <b>come</b> to the aid of their country.</p>
    <p>This was also an example of nested command</p>
